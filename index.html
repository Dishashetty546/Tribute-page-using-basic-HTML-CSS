    <h2>Biography</h2>
<!--small paragraph on luminary-->
    <p>Abdul Kalam, born in 1931, was a distinguished Indian scientist and the 11th President of India. Revered as the "Missile Man," he spearheaded India's missile and nuclear programs. His presidency (2002-2007) was marked by a focus on education and empowering youth. Kalam's influential books, including "Wings of Fire," continue to inspire generations. His untimely passing in 2015 while addressing students left a void, but his legacy of scientific brilliance and unwavering faith in India's capabilities lives on, shaping the aspirations of countless individuals.</p>
